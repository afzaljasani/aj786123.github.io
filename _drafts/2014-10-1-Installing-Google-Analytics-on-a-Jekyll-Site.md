A few weeks ago I finally decided to install Google Analytics on my personal website. The reason behind installing GA was to get a better understanding of how large of an audience was coming to my website and to see how they were interacting with the different pages. GA is great if you know how to navigate through all of its features and pull insights from the various metrics they track. I will admit though, if I had not learned how to GA from previous internships or my current work experience, it would be a bit overwhelming. 

Installing GA tracking code was actually pretty straightforward. I first went to the Google Analytics page to set up my account and get the tracking code. This is the screen to access the account and get the tracking code.
