<p>As more and more individuals jump on the bangwagon of starting their own companies and pitching their ideas to VCs, the more dulled down ideas are starting to appear. Across the industry in different fields, growing competitors are hacking and improving but are dismissing the “big ideas.” It could be because most startups have a 99% fail rate, so why not play it safe and hack something that has already been done before. However, it seems that the growing number of startups are lacking the innovation and quailty they once had over 10 years ago. Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and founder of The Social+Capital Partnership has stated the following: “We are at an absolute minimum in terms of things that are being started.” There are several sectors which could use more innovation and growth such as health care, education, and energy. But the lack of big ideas is making it a struggle for both investors and founders.</p>

<p>While looking back at the past and comparing it to the present might not be the best analogy, it does prove a point. VCs and founders are playing it safe to make minimal improvements to platforms which have been around since 2003. For huge revolutions, the ideas must stem from somewhere else, not the start up scene. It is not wrong to want bigger and better ideas, but given the circumstances we can not hope for something of the past to reappear.</p>

<p>Instead maybe we should wait and see what comes about in the next few years. There could perhaps be an idea we have never thought of or maybe a product which could tie many open ends together, maybe it is 3D printing, maybe it is a transformation in online education. Maybe Google will bring the next revolution in online connecivity. But until then we can only focus on making what we have more sustainable and scaleable in order to make these ideas expand beyond ourselves.</p>
