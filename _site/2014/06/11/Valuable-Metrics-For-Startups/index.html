  <h1 class="post-title">What are Valuable Metrics for Startups?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">11 Jun 2014</span>
  <p>Working in the startup scene has introduced me to several terms or acronyms I had never heard of before. Many of these terms are used in board meetings or shown to investors to represent how a company may be doing or how they are projected to do so in the following years. Being familiar or even an expert with these so called metrics is extremely important when working on the business or sales side of a startup.</p>

<p>The most specific of these terms fall under a category called business metrics. Business metrics help a startup measure their success and performance. These metrics can be shown as a rate or an absolute value. In my experience absolute values are not as versatile as rates or ratios. The best metrics are easy to understand and can be comparative. When I say easy to understand I mean your employees can easily refer to it and won&#39;t forget it. Having comparative metrics helps a company look at metrics from different time periods and segments. It is much easier to assess trends and forecasts future results with comparative metrics. Below you will find an unordered list of metrics I think are valuable for startups and what they mean exactly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Customer Acquisition</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer acquisition is a defining metric for many startups regardless if they are B2B or B2C. You want to know how many customers you are acquiring month to month and year to year. At the highest level this can tell you how easily adoptable your product or service might be. Breaking it down by acquisition channel is even more beneficial as your marketing team can then determine the most efficient and cost friendly channel to use.</p>

<p>After you have determined how many customers you are adding it is necessary to know the cost to acquire them. Figuring this number can be difficult. You need to remember that amount you spend on lets say, Facebook ads, is NOT your true cost. Instead you need to calculate the amount of customers that come from that channel. This is your conversion rate. For example, when using SEO (search engine optimization), if you are paying $2.00 per click and the conversion rate is 10% then your cost per customer is = $20  ($2.00/.10). This seems a little steep so you need to make sure you can make more than that much of off each customer!</p>

<ul>
<li>Churn </li>
</ul>

<p>Your customers are not always loyal and may leave you. This can happen because of multiple reasons (costs, low product quality, difficultly to use, etc.) But no need to worry there is a metric to calculate that! Retention rate is very important to your company and you want your customers to stay with you as long as possible.</p>

<p>To calculate, take the number of customers you lost in a given time period, lets say a month, and divide that number by the total number of customers you had at the beginning of the month. Company ABC had 400 customers at the beginning of June and lost 40 during that month. (400 - 360/400) = 10% customer churn rate.</p>

<p>You can also calculate your revenue churn which can get more complicated depending on your pricing model and what time period you are looking at. Another thing to note is that customer churn and revenue churn are not equivalent.  I will get into the intricacies of revenue churn in a separate blog post so I can go into more details.</p>

<ul>
<li>CLV </li>
</ul>

<p>Customer Lifetime Value predicts the net profit from a relationship with an customer. This is one of the most important metrics for marketing teams, because it segments customers into different buckets. Marketing strategy is sometimes dependent on the CLV of certain groups and which acquisition channel they came from. This also helps in developing new segments to target in the future. Separating your high value and low value customers can help you decide product upgrades and future pricing models as well. Here you can find a useful tool for determining your CLV.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sales </li>
</ul>

<p>Sales metrics are important because they can get into the granular data behind how well each salesman is doing at your company. Important things to measure here are conversion rates from trials to paid customers, revenue per salesman, opportunities to trials, and leads. Tracking meetings and calls are unnecessary and can have a negative impact on the behavior of each salesman. Each company will calculate these metrics based on how their organization functions. Your overall sales metrics are just as important. The aggregate sales funnel analysis lets managers know certain numbers they need to hit monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Relaying these numbers back to the sales team can push them to work harder and more efficiently to close deals and get more opportunities in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The above metrics are just a few that I feel are important for the health of a company. Measuring these can give you powerful insights and help you strategize for optimal growth. A baseline should be decided between teams and used to test metrics monthly until you have a better understanding of your customers and sales tactics.</p>
