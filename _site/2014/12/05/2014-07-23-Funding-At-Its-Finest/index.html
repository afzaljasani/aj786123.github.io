  <h1 class="post-title">Funding At It's Finest</h1>
  <span class="post-date">05 Dec 2014</span>
  <p>Many startups struggle to find the proper funding even if they create a great product. These startups range across all industries and can be B2B (business to business) or B2C (business to consumer). I believe that factors such as timing and location can increase the possibility of getting funding as a startup. Timing and location are extremely important to both investors and founders. Timing, for the sake of this article is, referring to which quarter the startup is raising capital. Location, means the actual geographical region that the startup is based out of. </p>

<p>Yo!, the messaging app which allows users to send the word &quot;Yo&quot; to other user, has riled up a ton of people because of its simplicity and &quot;uselessness&quot;. Just recently they raised $1.2 million in seed funding, at a time when many great startups are overlooked and find difficutly in raising funding. When the news broke, many of my coworkers laughed. Some thought they could have come up with the app themselves. Startups and funding can be a touchy subject. I thought it would be interesting to analyze funding trends and see if any correlations existed. I decided to use a tool called datapad and the crunchbase data set (last updated April 2014)</p>

<p>Crunchbase is a database used to aggregate startup activity. It contains information about founders, investors, funding rounds, location, news, and even more. I use crunchbase pretty often to keep track of new startups being funded and which startups are trending across the web. Using the data set they release publically and datapad I drilled down into the different funding rounds.</p>

<h2>Series A </h2>

<p>Given that a Series A round of funding is usually the most important/significant round for a startup, I decided to start my analysis there. Over the past few years many comapnies have raised a Series A round of funding which is usually between $1 to $5 million dollars, but can be upwards of $70 million. (outliers) The Series A round helps companies kickstart growth by hiring more employees and using some of that capital towards marketing needs. Of all company categories; software, web, and biotech companies ruled on top. Of the software companies, SF and NYC were the top cities. </p>

<p>In the past 5 years SF has outnumbered NYC in the number of companies with a Series A round by 34%. To place that into actual numbers, that is almost 200 more companies that have been invested in. That is a whole lot more money flowing into SF&#39;s ecosystem and only increasing the chances of acquisitions and IPOs for those investors. SF doubled the number of companies in the top categories as well. But if we take a closer look each year NYC has grown in the number of Series A companies. If NYC can continue this upward trend, which I don&#39;t see slowing down any time soon because of the abundant incubators/accelerators/VCs, it can definitely catch up to SF. </p>

<p>Other factors which stood out to me were the quarter in which most of these companies were invested in. I found that Pre - 2012 there was a large number of companies being funded in Q1 versus any other quarter. Post 2012 however, Q3 and Q4 saw increases in amount of companies funded. The funding quarter could be related to companies launching from beta to full product at the start of the year or VCs filling their fund with later investments. I think the influx of capital at the start of the fiscal year for a startup can really help it become more aligned with other companies time schedules. For SaaS(software as a service) companies specifically, working with potential customers at the start of the fiscal year can be benefical as they can find the budget for your service. </p>

<p>Going back to the Yo! example, we can see that they had done two smart things. One being they are based out of SF and two being they raised their funding in Q3. Both of these factors helped them secure seed funding.</p>
