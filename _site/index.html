        Funding At It's Finest
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Dec 2014</span>

    <p>Many startups struggle to find the proper funding even if they create a great product. These startups range across all industries and can be B2B (business to business) or B2C (business to consumer). I believe that factors such as timing and location can increase the possibility of getting funding as a startup. Timing and location are extremely important to both investors and founders. Timing, for the sake of this article is, referring to which quarter the startup is raising capital. Location, means the actual geographical region that the startup is based out of. </p>

<p>Yo!, the messaging app which allows users to send the word &quot;Yo&quot; to other user, has riled up a ton of people because of its simplicity and &quot;uselessness&quot;. Just recently they raised $1.2 million in seed funding, at a time when many great startups are overlooked and find difficutly in raising funding. When the news broke, many of my coworkers laughed. Some thought they could have come up with the app themselves. Startups and funding can be a touchy subject. I thought it would be interesting to analyze funding trends and see if any correlations existed. I decided to use a tool called datapad and the crunchbase data set (last updated April 2014)</p>

<p>Crunchbase is a database used to aggregate startup activity. It contains information about founders, investors, funding rounds, location, news, and even more. I use crunchbase pretty often to keep track of new startups being funded and which startups are trending across the web. Using the data set they release publically and datapad I drilled down into the different funding rounds.</p>

<h2>Series A </h2>

<p>Given that a Series A round of funding is usually the most important/significant round for a startup, I decided to start my analysis there. Over the past few years many comapnies have raised a Series A round of funding which is usually between $1 to $5 million dollars, but can be upwards of $70 million. (outliers) The Series A round helps companies kickstart growth by hiring more employees and using some of that capital towards marketing needs. Of all company categories; software, web, and biotech companies ruled on top. Of the software companies, SF and NYC were the top cities. </p>

<p>In the past 5 years SF has outnumbered NYC in the number of companies with a Series A round by 34%. To place that into actual numbers, that is almost 200 more companies that have been invested in. That is a whole lot more money flowing into SF&#39;s ecosystem and only increasing the chances of acquisitions and IPOs for those investors. SF doubled the number of companies in the top categories as well. But if we take a closer look each year NYC has grown in the number of Series A companies. If NYC can continue this upward trend, which I don&#39;t see slowing down any time soon because of the abundant incubators/accelerators/VCs, it can definitely catch up to SF. </p>

<p>Other factors which stood out to me were the quarter in which most of these companies were invested in. I found that Pre - 2012 there was a large number of companies being funded in Q1 versus any other quarter. Post 2012 however, Q3 and Q4 saw increases in amount of companies funded. The funding quarter could be related to companies launching from beta to full product at the start of the year or VCs filling their fund with later investments. I think the influx of capital at the start of the fiscal year for a startup can really help it become more aligned with other companies time schedules. For SaaS(software as a service) companies specifically, working with potential customers at the start of the fiscal year can be benefical as they can find the budget for your service. </p>

<p>Going back to the Yo! example, we can see that they had done two smart things. One being they are based out of SF and two being they raised their funding in Q3. Both of these factors helped them secure seed funding.</p>

        Installing Google Analytics on Jekyll Site

    <span class="post-date">01 Dec 2014</span>

    <p>A few weeks ago I finally decided to install Google Analytics on my personal website. The reason behind installing GA was to get a better understanding of how large of an audience was coming to my website and how they were interacting with each article. GA is great if you know how to navigate through all of its features and pull insights from the various metrics they track. I will admit though, if I had not learned how to use GA from previous internships or my current work experience, it would be a bit overwhelming. GA is robust and offers many tutorials through Google to become an analytics master. </p>

<p>Installing GA tracking code was actually pretty straightforward. I first went to the Google Analytics page to set up my account and get the tracking code. This is the screen to access your account and get the tracking code. </p>

<p>After you your tracking code, you need to navigate inside your folers to the _includes folder. In this folder you should open up the head.html file. Inside the head.html file you will want to paste the tracking code in between the </head> tag. </p>

        What are Valuable Metrics for Startups?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Working in the startup scene has introduced me to several terms or acronyms I had never heard of before. Many of these terms are used in board meetings or shown to investors to represent how a company may be doing or how they are projected to do so in the following years. Being familiar or even an expert with these so called metrics is extremely important when working on the business or sales side of a startup.</p>

<p>The most specific of these terms fall under a category called business metrics. Business metrics help a startup measure their success and performance. These metrics can be shown as a rate or an absolute value. In my experience absolute values are not as versatile as rates or ratios. The best metrics are easy to understand and can be comparative. When I say easy to understand I mean your employees can easily refer to it and won&#39;t forget it. Having comparative metrics helps a company look at metrics from different time periods and segments. It is much easier to assess trends and forecasts future results with comparative metrics. Below you will find an unordered list of metrics I think are valuable for startups and what they mean exactly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Customer Acquisition</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer acquisition is a defining metric for many startups regardless if they are B2B or B2C. You want to know how many customers you are acquiring month to month and year to year. At the highest level this can tell you how easily adoptable your product or service might be. Breaking it down by acquisition channel is even more beneficial as your marketing team can then determine the most efficient and cost friendly channel to use.</p>

<p>After you have determined how many customers you are adding it is necessary to know the cost to acquire them. Figuring this number can be difficult. You need to remember that amount you spend on lets say, Facebook ads, is NOT your true cost. Instead you need to calculate the amount of customers that come from that channel. This is your conversion rate. For example, when using SEO (search engine optimization), if you are paying $2.00 per click and the conversion rate is 10% then your cost per customer is = $20  ($2.00/.10). This seems a little steep so you need to make sure you can make more than that much of off each customer!</p>

<ul>
<li>Churn </li>
</ul>

<p>Your customers are not always loyal and may leave you. This can happen because of multiple reasons (costs, low product quality, difficultly to use, etc.) But no need to worry there is a metric to calculate that! Retention rate is very important to your company and you want your customers to stay with you as long as possible.</p>

<p>To calculate, take the number of customers you lost in a given time period, lets say a month, and divide that number by the total number of customers you had at the beginning of the month. Company ABC had 400 customers at the beginning of June and lost 40 during that month. (400 - 360/400) = 10% customer churn rate.</p>

<p>You can also calculate your revenue churn which can get more complicated depending on your pricing model and what time period you are looking at. Another thing to note is that customer churn and revenue churn are not equivalent.  I will get into the intricacies of revenue churn in a separate blog post so I can go into more details.</p>

<ul>
<li>CLV </li>
</ul>

<p>Customer Lifetime Value predicts the net profit from a relationship with an customer. This is one of the most important metrics for marketing teams, because it segments customers into different buckets. Marketing strategy is sometimes dependent on the CLV of certain groups and which acquisition channel they came from. This also helps in developing new segments to target in the future. Separating your high value and low value customers can help you decide product upgrades and future pricing models as well. Here you can find a useful tool for determining your CLV.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sales </li>
</ul>

<p>Sales metrics are important because they can get into the granular data behind how well each salesman is doing at your company. Important things to measure here are conversion rates from trials to paid customers, revenue per salesman, opportunities to trials, and leads. Tracking meetings and calls are unnecessary and can have a negative impact on the behavior of each salesman. Each company will calculate these metrics based on how their organization functions. Your overall sales metrics are just as important. The aggregate sales funnel analysis lets managers know certain numbers they need to hit monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Relaying these numbers back to the sales team can push them to work harder and more efficiently to close deals and get more opportunities in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The above metrics are just a few that I feel are important for the health of a company. Measuring these can give you powerful insights and help you strategize for optimal growth. A baseline should be decided between teams and used to test metrics monthly until you have a better understanding of your customers and sales tactics.</p>
