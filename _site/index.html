        Funding At It's Finest
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jul 2014</span>

    Yo!, the messaging app which allows users to send the word "Yo" to other users, has riled up a ton of people. Just recently they raised $1.2 million in angel funding, at a time when many great startups are overlooked and find difficutly in raising funding. When the news broke, many of my coworkers laughed. Some thought they could have come up with the app themselves. Startups and funding can be a touchy subject. Many struggle to find the proper funding even if they create a great product. I thought it would be interesting to analyze funding trends and see if there were any profound insights. I decided to use a tool called datapad and the crunchbase data set (last updated April 2014)

Crunchbase is a database used to aggregate startup activity. It contains information about founders, investors, funding rounds, location, news, and even more. I use crunchbase pretty often to keep track of new startups being funded and which startups are trending across the web. Using the data set they released publically and datapad I drilled down into the different funding rounds.

Series A 
-------------

Given that a Series A round of funding is usually the most important/significant round for a startup I decided to start there. Over the past few years many comapnies have raised a Series A round of funding which is usually between $1 to $5 million dollars, but can be upwards of $70 million. The Series A round helps companies kickstart growth by hiring more employees and using some of that capital towards marketing needs. Of all company categories; software, web, and biotech companies ruled on top. Of the software companies, SF and NYC were the most common city. 

In the past 5 years SF has outnumbered the number of companies with a Series A round by 34%. To place that into actual numbers, that is almost 200 more companies that have been invested in. That is a whole lot more money flowing into SF's ecosystem and only increasing the chances of acquisitions and IPOs for those investors. SF doubled the number of companies in the top categories as well. But if we take a closer look each year NYC has grown in the number of Series A companies. If NYC can continue this upward trend, which I don't see slowing down any time soon because of the abundant accelerator/VCs, it can definitely catch up to SF. 

Series B
--------------

After companies are up and running and hopefully managing some incoming revenue, they open up a Series B round of funding for additional investors to stimulate growth. These rounds of funding can range from medium to very large amounts,

        What are Valuable Metrics for Startups?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Working in the startup scene has introduced me to several terms or acronyms I had never heard of before. Many of these terms are used in board meetings or shown to investors to represent how a company may be doing or how they are projected to do so in the following years. Being familiar or even an expert with these so called metrics is extremely important when working on the business or sales side of a startup.</p>

<p>The most specific of these terms fall under a category called business metrics. Business metrics help a startup measure their success and performance. These metrics can be shown as a rate or an absolute value. In my experience absolute values are not as versatile as rates or ratios. The best metrics are easy to understand and can be comparative. When I say easy to understand I mean your employees can easily refer to it and won&#39;t forget it. Having comparative metrics helps a company look at metrics from different time periods and segments. It is much easier to assess trends and forecasts future results with comparative metrics. Below you will find an unordered list of metrics I think are valuable for startups and what they mean exactly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Customer Acquisition</li>
</ul>

<p>Customer acquisition is a defining metric for many startups regardless if they are B2B or B2C. You want to know how many customers you are acquiring month to month and year to year. At the highest level this can tell you how easily adoptable your product or service might be. Breaking it down by acquisition channel is even more beneficial as your marketing team can then determine the most efficient and cost friendly channel to use.</p>

<p>After you have determined how many customers you are adding it is necessary to know the cost to acquire them. Figuring this number can be difficult. You need to remember that amount you spend on lets say, Facebook ads, is NOT your true cost. Instead you need to calculate the amount of customers that come from that channel. This is your conversion rate. For example, when using SEO (search engine optimization), if you are paying $2.00 per click and the conversion rate is 10% then your cost per customer is = $20  ($2.00/.10). This seems a little steep so you need to make sure you can make more than that much of off each customer!</p>

<ul>
<li>Churn </li>
</ul>

<p>Your customers are not always loyal and may leave you. This can happen because of multiple reasons (costs, low product quality, difficultly to use, etc.) But no need to worry there is a metric to calculate that! Retention rate is very important to your company and you want your customers to stay with you as long as possible.</p>

<p>To calculate, take the number of customers you lost in a given time period, lets say a month, and divide that number by the total number of customers you had at the beginning of the month. Company ABC had 400 customers at the beginning of June and lost 40 during that month. (400 - 360/400) = 10% customer churn rate.</p>

<p>You can also calculate your revenue churn which can get more complicated depending on your pricing model and what time period you are looking at. Another thing to note is that customer churn and revenue churn are not equivalent.  I will get into the intricacies of revenue churn in a separate blog post so I can go into more details.</p>

<ul>
<li>CLV </li>
</ul>

<p>Customer Lifetime Value predicts the net profit from a relationship with an customer. This is one of the most important metrics for marketing teams, because it segments customers into different buckets. Marketing strategy is sometimes dependent on the CLV of certain groups and which acquisition channel they came from. This also helps in developing new segments to target in the future. Separating your high value and low value customers can help you decide product upgrades and future pricing models as well. Here you can find a useful tool for determining your CLV.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sales </li>
</ul>

<p>Sales metrics are important because they can get into the granular data behind how well each salesman is doing at your company. Important things to measure here are conversion rates from trials to paid customers, revenue per salesman, opportunities to trials, and leads. Tracking meetings and calls are unnecessary and can have a negative impact on the behavior of each salesman. Each company will calculate these metrics based on how their organization functions. Your overall sales metrics are just as important. The aggregate sales funnel analysis lets managers know certain numbers they need to hit monthly, quarterly, and yearly. Relaying these numbers back to the sales team can push them to work harder and more efficiently to close deals and get more opportunities in the pipeline.</p>

<p>The above metrics are just a few that I feel are important for the health of a company. Measuring these can give you powerful insights and help you strategize for optimal growth. A baseline should be decided between teams and used to test metrics monthly until you have a better understanding of your customers and sales tactics.</p>

        Using an API for the First Time
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Nov 2013</span>

    <p>This past summer as I continued my internship with Parse.ly I got the opportunity to work on a side project that did not involve business or marketing, but instead programming. Everyone at Parse.ly loved the idea of me going out of my way to learn something and program it. This small project came up one day when we were using our IRC client, Flowdock, and the CEO asking if we could somehow write commands into Flowdock which would then return GIFs of the specific keywords we included. As any other tech startup we love using GIFs :) For example anyone in any of the flows(chats) could put “!catgif” and Flowdock would return a random GIF of a cat! Sounds pretty awesome right? Well the really awesome part is that Flowdock actually has an API that users can interact with and create such a program. Having only minimal python skills and a little help from a fellow intern I got started on the project. The specific API which I used for this project was the streaming API and the push API. I also needed to find a resource where I could pull random GIFs, for this I used <a href="http://thecatapi.com/&amp;#8221">http://thecatapi.com/&amp;#8221</a>.</p>

<p>What I needed to do first was lay out a few functions which would take in the information I needed and leave the rest out. Using the stream API enabled me to process all the information that went into each flow and find specific keywords that matched what I wanted to use as a command. After finding the specific keywords and if they matched the next function would send a GIF back through flowdock in that specific flow where the keyword was found. I was able to change who appeared to return the GIF as well. As a default I put it as Flowbot because it was our very own robot which interacted with us. Later on people used the code to change it to other people’s name and do funny things with it.</p>

<p>Overall, using the Flowdock API was an interesting and enriching experience. I think it was a good API to use as a beginner programmer and Flowdock themselves provided plenty of documentation to help me along the way. As I practice and learn more python I hope to user other APIs to build different programs.</p>

<p>You can find the code here on github: <a href="https://github.com/aj786123/pyFlowBot/blob/master/pyflowbot.py">https://github.com/aj786123/pyFlowBot/blob/master/pyflowbot.py</a></p>
